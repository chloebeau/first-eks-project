# first-eks-project
Here is the code I used on my first kubernetes project with AWS, including a microservice.
Kubernetes has fascinated me since I heard of GKE in 2018-ish. Then I had a brief stint in the sales department of a K8's startup in 2023.
Then my knowledge expanded past this amazing containerized application host that Google created into something that could also be hosted by the cloud provider that made me fall in love with cloud computing.
Here you'll see the code I used to create an EKS cluster, docker files, microservice, shut it down, etc but the AWS instance itself is not here because I didn't want to continue paying for consumption on 
an instance I was using for demonstration purposes only.
This repository truly is a marrying of all of the technical concepts I've been drawn to and now understand pretty well. :)
